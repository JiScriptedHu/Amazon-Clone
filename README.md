# Amazon Clone

This project is a clone of the Amazon website, created using HTML and CSS. It serves as a practice project to improve my skills in frontend web development.

# Project Description

Purpose: To practice and reinforce my learning in HTML and CSS.

Current State: Basic structure and styling, replicating the look and feel of Amazon's main page.

Future Plans: I plan to add interactivity, responsiveness, and more features over time.
